How the data will be used to solve the problem\n\nThe data will be used as follows:\n- Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Chenna neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)\n- Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of Restraunts , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each Restraunts \n\n\n\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n\n- what is the area of Chennai with best Restaurants? \n\n- How venues distribute among Chennai neighborhoods and around Hotels and Restraunts?\n\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the Restaurants and overall data.\n"
